  <description brief="arduino_interface">

     The arduino_interface class contains details specifics to 
     interfacing sensors with software using an Arduino as
     the physical hardware interface.  
     
     Each instantiation of this class is specific to an 
     Arduino hardware device, indentified by the serial port  name.
     
     NOTE: To use this package, you must deactivate the Arduino's
     pullups on the SDA and SCL lines. By default, these pullups are
     enabled. To deactivate them, you must open the Wire library in 
     your libraries folder and comment out two lines in the twi.c 
     sketch.
     
     This class inherits the bosch_drivers_hardware_interface
     base class. In this manner, specific bosch_drivers_sensor_driver
     classes can access sensor data through the virtual functions provided by 
     the parent bosch_drivers_hardware_interface class.

     The arduino_firmware directory contains a makefile and .ino code for
     building the hex files to upload to the Arduino. After a `make', type
     `make upload' to upload to firmware to the Arduino.
