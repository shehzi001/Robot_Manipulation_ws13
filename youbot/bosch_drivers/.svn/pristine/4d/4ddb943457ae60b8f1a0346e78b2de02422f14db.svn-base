  <description brief="Collection of hardware drivers.">

    This stack primarily contains drivers for MEMS sensors from Bosch Sensortec. Sensors
    require a hardware interface, such as an Ardunio, to connect to the computer.
    The drivers are not dependent on ROS, but basic ROS nodes are provided.

    Other hardware drivers in use at Bosch RTC are also found in this stack.
