 * \brief      a bmc050 driver that implements the device's main

 *
 * \details     This class provides access to the acceleration 
 * temperature, and Magnetic field data.  Routines have been written to 
 * change settings on both sensors, such as bandwidth and range.
 * Routines have also been written to change modes.
 * \note       Not all capabilities of the sensors have been 
 * implemented.  For example, the user cannot directly implement the 
 * accelerometer's built-in slope-detection routines.  However, 
 * these routines may be implemented using several of the existing 
 * methods.
 * \note     This class implements its methods through a generic
 * hardware interface.
